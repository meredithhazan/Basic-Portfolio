	<p>
	Meredith Hazan, Maritime&#x00027;s founder, has long been a follower of fashion. Growing up in the suburbs of Chicago, early memories include annual trips to the Florence Eiseman Factory sale in Wisconsin, coveting her first pair of "designer" jeans (they were Girbauds), and discovering Urban Outfitters on a family trip to Georgetown.

	Her training was formalized at Columbia College Chicago where she received a Bachelor's Degree in Fashion Retail Management and Merchandising. After nearly two years in London with the commercial department of British designer Clements Ribeiro, she moved to Los Angeles in 2002 and switched to full-time wholesale sales spending a combined six years working at two renowned multiline showrooms, 10Eleven and HATCh Inc. There she represented top contemporary lines including Lacoste, IISLi, and Jet by John Eshaya.
